### Description

This is just a program intro I had for a Yahoo Booter I made a while back. A lot of people asked how I did it so I figured I would upload it here to show you a way to do it with out using Flash. This is just simple code using timers and OLE. Please vote if you wish, I am not out to win the nobel peace prize...just wanted to show something I really have never seen here before.
